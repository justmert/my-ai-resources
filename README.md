# my-ai-resources

My background on machine learning and deep learning,

I am interested mainly in computer vision and its applications, so a lot of resources will be about them. This doesn't mean that i don't like nlp or other research areas, it is just what i have started the journey because of interest.

## Mooc

- [ X ] CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

  > I have taken CS231N 2017 by Stanford. Altough, i liked the course very much, i thought it is best to practice what i have learned by the lecture 12 so i didn't watch last 4 courses because generative models (Gan) needs a detailed focus. The theoritical part was so heavy which is why i liked the course very much. I think it would be a great couple with Stanford CS 224N] (http://cs224n.stanford.edu/) which is what i am thinking to attend. 

- [ X ] Fastai: Practical Deep Learning for Coders

  > Well, needless to say Jeremy Howard is awesome. The course was top to bottom, which is the reverse teaching technique of the cs231n. I enjoyed the course but it would better to focus on Pytorch, instead of Fastai library. Altough Fastai library is built upon Pytorch, i just didn't prefer to use Fastai

- [ X ] Course Andrew Ng: Machine Learning

  > I don't need to say anything, right? Defacto machine learning course.

-  [ ~ ] [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

  >I have completed two courses from the specialization that will help me to understand Pandas, Regex, and Matplotlib. The courses were fairly easy to understand.

## Books

There are a lot of good books out there but i am a fast learner and reading all the books from start to end is exhausting task so i only take small portion and read or apply it. I will not listen all of them because it would unnecessary.

## Libraries

**Pytorch** is my most loved library, it is just awesome. Other than that i have tried Tensorflow, but it is inconsistent which is why i don't prefer to use it. His big brother Keras is just like Fastai, they have created so many layers above pytorch, and tensorflow that it is getting hard to grasp of the logic in the deep learning application. Besides, machine learning libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib is must to know.

## University Lessons

I am currently taking these courses about ai related at my university:

* Ceng313 - Introduction to Data Science

* BM455 - Yapay Zekaya Giris
* CENG489 - Data Mining

## Reseources

Well, there are a lot of resources that i have skimmed, read or watched to understand concepts. So it is impossible to search them. 

But,

* I have followed Pytorch official tutorials
* Read many medium blogs about implementations
* Examined notebooks in the Kaggle platform

## Favourites

* Paper: [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style by Leon A.Gatsy](A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style)

* Intuition: [3blue1brown neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PL_h2yd2CGtBHEKwEH5iqTZH85wLS-eUzv)
